SQL Code:

**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT t1.product_id, CASE WHEN new_price IS NULL THEN old_price ELSE new_price END AS price
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT product_id AS product_id, 10 AS old_price
    FROM Products
) AS t1 LEFT JOIN
(
    SELECT *, rank() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS ranking
    FROM Products
    WHERE DATEDIFF(change_date, '2019-08-16') <= 0
) AS t2
ON t1.product_id = t2.product_id
WHERE ranking = 1 OR ranking IS NULL
```

**Solution 2, 用GROUP BY**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT t1.product_id, CASE WHEN new_price IS NULL THEN old_price ELSE new_price END AS price
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT product_id AS product_id, 10 AS old_price
    FROM Products
) AS t1 LEFT JOIN
(
    SELECT product_id, new_price
    FROM Products
    WHERE (product_id, change_date) in (
        SELECT product_id, MAX(change_date)
        FROM Products
        WHERE DATEDIFF(change_date, '2019-08-16') <= 0
        GROUP BY product_id
    )

) AS t2
ON t1.product_id = t2.product_id
```
