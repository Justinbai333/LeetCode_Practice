SQL Code:

**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT company_id, employee_id, employee_name, ROUND(CASE
    WHEN MAX(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY company_id) < 1000 THEN salary
    WHEN MAX(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY company_id) BETWEEN 1000 AND 10000 THEN 0.76 * salary
    ELSE 0.51 * salary END, 0)
    AS salary
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY company_id, employee_id
```

**Note:**

- CASE WHEN可以直接用来定义参数
