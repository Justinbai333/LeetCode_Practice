SQL Code:

**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT id, SUM(friend_num) AS num
FROM (
    SELECT requester_id AS id, COUNT(accepter_id) AS friend_num
    FROM request_accepted
    GROUP BY requester_id

    UNION ALL

    SELECT accepter_id AS id, COUNT(requester_id) AS friend_num
    FROM request_accepted
    GROUP BY accepter_id
) AS temp
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 1
```

**NOTE:**

- UNION / UNION ALL的区别：**UNION 会自动去重**，在本题中，如果一个人加别人好友的次数和被加好友的次数相同会被去重。
