SQL Code:

**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT sale_date, SUM(CASE WHEN fruit = 'apples' THEN sold_num ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN fruit = 'oranges' THEN sold_num ELSE 0 END) AS diff
FROM Sales
GROUP BY sale_date
ORDER BY sale_date
```

**Solution 2**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT sale_date, SUM(CASE WHEN fruit = 'apples' THEN sold_num ELSE -sold_num END) AS diff
FROM Sales
GROUP BY sale_date
ORDER BY sale_date
```


**NOTE:**

- (CASE WHEN THEN ELSE END)语法的复习
- 评论大佬这个-sold_num就很灵性（但是感觉普适性不高，万一还有别的水果就不能这么写了）
