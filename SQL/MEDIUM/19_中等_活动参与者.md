SQL Code:

**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT activity
FROM Friends
GROUP BY activity
HAVING COUNT(*) <> (SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_ac FROM Friends GROUP BY activity ORDER BY count_ac LIMIT 1)
AND COUNT(*) <> (SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_ac FROM Friends GROUP BY activity ORDER BY count_ac DESC LIMIT 1)
```

**Solution 2**

```SQL

SELECT activity
FROM Friends
GROUP BY activity
HAVING
COUNT(*)>SOME(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Friends GROUP BY activity)
AND
COUNT(*)<SOME(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Friends GROUP BY activity)
```

**NOTE**

- \> SOME(), 即满足比一列中的任意一个大即可，可以用 \> ANY()替换。
- 共有SOME(), ANY(), ALL()三种
- = ANY() 可以用来替换 IN()
