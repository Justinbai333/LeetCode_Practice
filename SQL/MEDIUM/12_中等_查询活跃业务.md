SQL Code:

**Solution 1 一开始的想法，两层窗口函数**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT DISTINCT business_id
FROM (
    SELECT business_id, SUM( CASE
    WHEN occurences > average THEN 1
    ELSE 0 END
    ) OVER(PARTITION BY business_id) AS active_business
    FROM (
        SELECT *, AVG(occurences) OVER(PARTITION BY event_type) AS average
        FROM Events
    ) AS temp1
) AS temp2
WHERE active_business >= 2
```

**Solution 2 改进版**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT business_id
FROM (
    SELECT *, AVG(occurences) OVER(PARTITION BY event_type) AS average
    FROM Events
) AS temp1
WHERE occurences > average
GROUP BY business_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
```
**NOTE:**
- 合理利用WHERE语句先于GROUP BY语句的特性，可以先用where做筛选然后再用GROUP BY()和HAVING COUNT数数
