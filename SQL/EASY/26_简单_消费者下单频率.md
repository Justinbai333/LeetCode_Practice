SQL Code:

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT customer_id, name
FROM  (
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, order_month, SUM(total_price) over (partition by customer_id,                  order_month) as month_sum, name
    FROM (
        SELECT c.customer_id, p.product_id, DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m') as order_month, quantity *              price AS total_price, name
        FROM Orders o LEFT JOIN Product p
        ON  o.product_id = p.product_id
        LEFT JOIN Customers c
        ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    ) AS tempA
) AS tempB
WHERE (order_month = '2020-06' and month_sum >= 100) or (order_month = '2020-07' and month_sum >= 100)
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = 2
```
Solution 2: 把条件都放在HAVING里

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

select c.customer_id,c.name
from customers c
join orders o on o.customer_id=c.customer_id
join product p on p.product_id=o.product_id
group by c.customer_id, c.name
having sum(case when left(o.order_date,7)='2020-06' then p.price*o.quantity else 0 end)>=100 and
sum(case when left(o.order_date,7)='2020-07' then p.price*o.quantity else 0 end)>=100
```
